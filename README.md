### Hi there 👋

It's so nice of you stop by! ☺️

I work as a Developer Advocate 🥑 at [Vonage](https://github.com/Nexmo) and live near Tel Aviv in Israel 🇮🇱. 

We are a remote-friendly globally distributed team of people with all kinds of skills and interests. If you're looking for a new role, take a look at [the openings](https://grnh.se/feb647932us)!

I also am a co-organizer of [israel.rb 💎](https://www.facebook.com/groups/272757750683415), which is Israel's Ruby meetup community. While I work in a variety of languages, Ruby has a special place in my 💙.
